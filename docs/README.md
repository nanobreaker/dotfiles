# Configuration Repository For Linux/Darwin Based Hosts
This repository contains configuration files based on nix package manager, that can be easily applied to any linux/darwin host system.

> [!note] Disclaimer: This repo is frequently updated and I'm currently migrating from my old dotfiles to this one based on flakes. Will document everything at some point.

# Motivation
During my lifetime I often had a situation where I had a clean machine with nothing installed on it, and as any other normal person I would configure it all ground up manually, but doing this again and again started to drive me crazy, you can see this process made of two parts, first installing my favorite software and second is configuring it to reflect my workflow as much as possible. For quite long time I used to have a dotfiles repository with the configs, but I didn't find it pleasant to use until I found out about nix package manager, flakes, home-manager and the whole ecosystem around it, this changed my view on things. From this moment I'm relying on nix as build system for my development environment which can target hosts that I often use in my daily life and work.
